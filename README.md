# Assignment: Capture the Flag

## Objective
The goal of the assignment is twofold:
1. **Create a "capture the flag" task** for your colleagues.
2. **Capture one (or more) flags** created by your colleagues.

## Group Organization
- The assignment must be performed in **groups of 3 (max)** persons.
- Groups **MUST** be organized through the [Excel sheet in the shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-_HtEyGc3tTrvuDlHukHDiNrUBF0PhFB?usp=sharing).
- Groups can be **mixed**, with members from Science or Engineering.

## Step 1: Create a "Capture the Flag" Task
Your group must create a task that includes the following components:

1. **Docker container** with a vulnerable target (your choice).
2. **README** file to describe the task (avoid giving spoilers).
3. **Short report** that includes:
   - The reason for choosing the task.
   - The intended way to capture (attack) the flag.

### Difficulty Level
- Mark your task as either **easy** or **medium** based on its foreseen difficulty.

---

## Step 2: Capture a Task
Your group must choose one (or more) tasks created by other groups (you **cannot** choose your own task) and attempt to capture the flag.

### Outcome
Produce a **short report** that includes:
- **Why you chose the task.**
- **How you captured the flag.**
  - Document both successful and unsuccessful attempts.

---

## Group Work Guidelines
- Work **collaboratively** as a group.
- All reports must clearly indicate:
  - **Group members.**
  - **Each person's contribution.**

---

## Additional Information
- The [Excel sheet for group organization](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-_HtEyGc3tTrvuDlHukHDiNrUBF0PhFB?usp=sharing) is in the shared folder.
- Container images can be stored:
  - In the **shared folder**, or
  - In an **online repository** (your choice).

## Have Fun!
Enjoy the process of creating and capturing flags!
